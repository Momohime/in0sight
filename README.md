The extension is able to obfuscate as much information as it can take. You can hide entire PGP messages inside version 1. 
Version 1 supports almost every single spacial character and uppercase letters as well.

Versions 2.0 and 2.1 however are a lot more limited. They offer compatibility for sites like Twitter and Protonmail. 

If you come across any bugs or questions feel free to contact this account or email at PlanetRenox@PM.ME

###### Some sites such as github it seems like, do use zero width characters in their interface functionality and that will set off the detector. This is a known issue and we will try to narrow it down in the future.
