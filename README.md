The extension is able to obfuscate as much information as it can take. You can hide entire PGP messages inside version 1. 
Versions 2.0 and 2.1 are a lot more limited. They offer compatibility for sites like Twitter and Protonmail. 

If you come across any bugs or questions submit them to the issues tab or email at planetrenox@pm.me

###### Some sites use zero width characters in their ui functionality and that will set off the 10sec notice. This is a known issue and we will try to narrow it down in the future.

The current roadmap for the next update currently includes reworking the 10 second notice, introducing a much more efficient algorithm to reduce storage size in case of obfuscating larger chunks of text, having the extension auto detect the version, and a completely seperate java client to be run in a desktop enviroment for windows, mac, and linux. And when the more minor details are stable, introduce password encryption on top of the zero width obfuscation.
