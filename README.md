# in√òsight

The extension is able to obfuscate as much information as it can take. You can hide entire PGP messages inside version 1. 
Version 1 supports almost every single spacial character and uppercase letters as well.

Versions 2.0 and 2.1 however are a lot more limited. They offer compatibility for sites like Twitter and Protonmail. 

If you come across any bugs or questions feel free to contact this account.

This was more of a fun personal project for practice. However I did ultimately try to create something that i'd want to use myself if I were someone browsing the firefox addons store. If you do come across here and do end up using the addon, definitly let me know your thoughts.
