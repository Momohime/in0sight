By default all sites should be compatible with version 1, however rarely some sites such as Twitter restrict some characters so that's why multiple versions exist. Since the addon is still new this list is going to be short, if you discover anything please email or contact us here on github.

Version 1.0: Majority of sites

Version 2.0: V1 + Twitter

Version 2.1: V1 + Protonmail

-----------------------------------------

At the moment, version 1 is the most complete algorithm. Even PGP messages are supported.
